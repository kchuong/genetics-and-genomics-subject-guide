# Genetics and Genomics Subject Guide

Pulling in the National Library of Medicine's "Collection Development Manual" to convert and test in Gitbook

The original NLM subject guide can be found here: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/index.html

## Process

1. Gather the html for the entire subject guide
2. Convert html to markdown (read up on markdown basics -->  https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) 
3. Clean up, if necessary 
4. Format the gitbook within the appropriate github repository or within the web-based gitbook editor
5. Publish and commit
