Cassidy SB, Allanson JE. [Management of genetic syndromes][1]. 3rd ed. Hoboken(NJ): Wiley-Blackwell; 2010. This book is available in multiple formats, including ebook. It includes information about the diagnosis and therapy of multiple genetic abnormalities and the diagnosis of inborn genetic diseases.

Collins FS. [The language of life : DNA and the revolution in personalized medicine][2]. NY: Harper Perennial; 2011, c2010. Collins targets the general public, starting with an overview of Genetics 101, then some discussion of the overall risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer and the promise of personalized medicine, which tailors treatment to an individual's genetic makeup. He discusses the promise and perils of genome-based medicine, genetic testing and its relevance to health care.

Fundukian LJ, editor. [Gale encyclopedia of genetic disorders][3]. 3rd ed. Vol. I &amp; II. Farmington Hills (MI): Gale; 2010. Provides genetic disorders information, including conditions, tests, procedures, treatments and therapies, in articles meant to be in language accessible to laypersons.

Ginsbrug GS, Willard HF, editors. [Genomic and personalized medicine][4]. 2nd ed. Vol. I &amp; II Waltham (MA): Elsevier/Academic Press; 2013.This in-depth set includes diagnostic testing information, population screening, disease susceptibility prediction, pharmacogenomics and more. Also has information for health policy disciplines focusing on ethical, legal, regulatory and economic aspects of genomics and medicine.

Lesk AM. [Introduction to genomics][5]. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press; c2012. This book explains what we learn from the study of genomes, how organisms differ or match, how different organisms evolved, how the genome is constructed, and the current state of molecular biology. It has a wide scope useful as an introduction to the field and includes biology topics that changed in recent years as a consequence of the genomics age.

Maloy SR, Hughes K. [Brenner's encyclopedia of genetics.][6] 2nd ed. San Diego: Academic Press; 2013. This edition addresses newer subfields of genetics.

Nussbaum RL, McInnes RR, Willard HF. [Thompson &amp; Thompson genetics in medicine.][7] 7th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders/Elsevier; 2007. This edition of fundamentals about human genetics and genomics applied to health and disease expands its scope to incorporate personalized medicine. It features clinical cases and has an online counterpart of fully searchable text with links to content from other Elsevier titles.

Richards JE, Hawley RS. [The Human Genome: a users guide. ][8]3rd ed. Elsevier science in society series. London; Amsterdam; Boston: Academic Press/Elsevier; 2011. This book has stories and examples to enhance genetic literacy of persons of various levels of scientific background. It presents the science and ethics of genetic data and what can be done with that information. The authors include developments from the Human Genome Project and current issues regarding cloning, gene therapy, and genetic ethics, including the eugenics movement. The book features colorful illustrations, boxes highlighting information, case studies, and concept statements.

Skloot R. [The immortal life of Henrietta Lacks][9]. New York: Crown Publishers; c2010. This is the story of a 31-year-old black mother of five who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, doctors took tissue samples from her cervix for research. The result was the first viable cell line—known as HeLa—that has since aided medical discoveries. But her story illustrates how modern science can exploit a vulnerable person in the name of science.

Turnpenny PD, Ellard S. [Emery's elements of medical genetics][10]. 14th ed. Philadelphia: Churchill Livingstone; 2012. This is a review of medical genetic topics for practice or exams featuring "user-friendly" design (full-color diagrams, clinical photographs of genetic diseases, review questions, end-of-chapter summaries, restricted online access at www.studentconsult.com). It promotes application of basic principles of genetics to clinical situations.
